* [X] src/gui/cli/
* [X] Terminal interface using the ncurses library
* [X] Function that outputs a matrix that describes the current state of the playing field
* [X] Playing field size: 10 X 20

### Mechanics

* [X] Rotation of pieces
* [X] Moving pieces horizontally
* [X] Acceleration of the piece's fall (when the button is pressed, the figure moves all the way down)
* [X] Display of the next piece
* [X] Destruction of filled raws
* [X] End of the game when the top border of the playing field is reached

### Bonus. Scoring and game record

* [X] Scoring (1 row - 100, 2 - 300, 3 - 700, 4 - 1500)
* [X] Storing maximum points - must be stored in a file

### Bonus. Level mechanics

* [X] Each 600 points = +1 level (boosts the speed at which the pieces move)
* [X] The maximum number of levels is 10

### Makefile

* [X] make: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, test, gcov_report
* [X] Installation directory can be arbitrary

### Tests

* [X] Unit Tests
* [X] Leaks MacOS: leaks -atExit -- ./main.out | grep LEAK:
* [X] Leaks Ubuntu: valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./main.out
* [X] Linter
* [X] MiniVerter
* [X] gcov >= 80%
